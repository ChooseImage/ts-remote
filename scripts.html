                Can you tell me more?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Years ago I had a dream that I was fleeing across an open field with a group of frightened people trying to escape some sort of apocalypse. It was dusk and storm clouds hung heavy in the sky. We ran away from a large city surrounded by emptiness, bristling with abandoned skyscrapers and hunched dead atop a hill. A stream ran through the field and we followed it hoping it would lead us to safety.
Suddenly, one of the group called out a warning. We all stopped and looked back towards the city to see a vehicle moving toward us at a relaxed speed, kicking up a small cloud of dust as it trundled along. The de facto leader of our group, a heavyset bearded guy whom I felt was familiar but couldn't quite place, told us to wait and see who it was. As the vehicle got closer we saw that it was a flatbed truck carrying a set of risers three high, the kind of risers a choir might use on stage. The truck pulled up alongside us, between my group and the stream, and sat idling.
The risers on the truck bed were lined with puppies. They sat up on their haunches, all facing us in rows. Each one wore a tiny robe as if they were members of the cutest church choir, though their expressions were anything but cute. The puppy-dog choir wore expressions of stern disapproval on their angry little faces, and because of this I knew it was a mistake to stop for them. Even more jarring was what each dog held in its paw: a severed cat head, held by the fur at the top of the head. The neck stump of each cat head was ragged, as if it was torn off its body rather than neatly severed. The truck's engine shut off, and in the eerie silence the puppies started making music.
The pups played the cat heads like theremins, holding the heads in one paw and moving the other paw near them to produce sound. The music they played sounded like a chorus of bells, except each note started much more softly than a struck bell's tone. It had an uncomfortable, discordant sound to it, and my party quickly decided it was time to get out of there. We ran, horrified at the puppies' performance, continuing along the stream as before. The puppy choir sternly watched us leave, their song providing us with an unnerving soundtrack for our flight, and then I woke up.

                ,the United States had been reduced to a small coastal strip around the city of Los Angeles. Canada had been split into a series of islands. China had been reunited under the control of the Manchu dynasty. and Australia had been renamed the Greater Australia Penin- sula. Europe and Asia had been reunited under the control of the Byzantine Empire. and the last of the ice sheets had melted. 

In the United States. Canada. and Australia. the remnants of the military-industrial complex had turned the former nations into fortress-like states. In China. the remnants of the former communist government had turned the nation into a militarized police state.
